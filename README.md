### Browser Compatibility
- Chrome 88+
- Chromium-based browsers (Edge, Brave, etc.)

## How It Works

### Visible Area Capture
1. Uses Chrome's `captureVisibleTab` API
2. Processes the image to optionally add URL header
3. Opens preview in new tab

### Entire Page Capture
1. Injects content script into the current page
2. Scrolls through the entire page systematically
3. Captures multiple screenshots and stitches them together
4. Creates a composite image of the full page
5. Opens preview in new tab

### Preview System
1. Opens a dedicated preview tab with professional interface
2. Displays the screenshot with metadata (URL, timestamp)
3. Provides download and clipboard copy functionality
4. Supports keyboard shortcuts for power users

## Development

The extension is built using:
- Manifest V3 for modern Chrome extension standards
- Canvas API for image processing and composition
- Async/await patterns for better performance
- Modern CSS with backdrop filters and animations
- Responsive design principles

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Screenshots appear blank**: Ensure the page has finished loading before capturing
- **Full page capture incomplete**: Some dynamic content may not be captured if it loads after scrolling
- **Copy to clipboard fails**: Ensure you're using a modern browser with clipboard API support

### Performance Notes
- Full page capture may take longer on very long pages
- Large images may consume significant memory during processing
- Preview tab automatically handles image optimization
